# Smidigakademiet Organization Design - Reference System

## Project Overview
This Docusaurus site serves as a knowledge base for the Smidigakademiet Organization Design Reference System. It's a tool to help organizations understand their current state, define their vision, and identify gaps between them.

## Core Concept
The system provides different "lenses" through which organizations can be viewed and analyzed. Each lens offers:
- **Theory**: Conceptual foundations and principles
- **Tools**: Drawing and modeling tools for visualization and analysis
- **Patterns & Anti-patterns**: Best practices to follow and pitfalls to avoid

## Site Structure
- **Introduction**: Main landing page introducing the reference system
- **About the Reference System**: Explanation of what it is and how to use it
- **Lenses**: Individual pages for each lens (5-9 planned total)
  - Each lens page contains Theory, Tools, and Patterns sections (not sub-pages)

## Current Lenses

### 1. Team and Product Group Structure
- **Focus**: Team topology, types of teams, and product group organization
- **Key Anti-pattern**: Too many teams organized around IT architecture components
- **Status**: In development

### Future Lenses (Planned: 4-8 additional)
- TBD based on organizational design needs

## Technical Details
- **Domain**: laug.smidigakademiet.no
- **GitHub Repo**: SmidigStorm/laug-docusaurus
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automatic deployment on push to main

## Development Notes
- Keep theory, tools, and patterns on single pages per lens (not separate sub-pages)
- Maintain consistent structure across all lenses
- Focus on practical application for organizational transformation
