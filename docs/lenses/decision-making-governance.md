# Decision Making and Governance

This lens examines how decisions are made, who has authority to make them, and how governance structures enable or constrain organizational effectiveness.

## Overview

Decision-making patterns fundamentally shape organizational agility, speed, and quality of outcomes. This lens helps you understand and optimize how decisions flow through your organization, from strategic choices to daily operational decisions.

## Theory

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Decision Rights
Decision rights define who has the authority to make specific types of decisions. Clear decision rights reduce delays, eliminate conflicts, and increase accountability.

#### Types of Decisions
- **Strategic decisions** - Direction, investment, major initiatives
- **Tactical decisions** - Resource allocation, prioritization, processes
- **Operational decisions** - Daily execution, implementation details

#### Decision Quality vs Speed Trade-offs
Organizations must balance:
- **Quality** - Thoroughness, analysis, stakeholder input
- **Speed** - Time to decision, responsiveness to change
- **Reversibility** - Ability to change course if wrong

### Governance Models

#### Centralized Governance
- Decisions made at senior levels
- Consistent standards and control
- Risk: Bottlenecks and slow response

#### Decentralized Governance
- Decisions pushed to edges
- Faster response and local optimization
- Risk: Inconsistency and misalignment

#### Federated Governance
- Balance of central standards and local autonomy
- Clear boundaries between central and local decisions
- Shared accountability frameworks

### Decision-Making Frameworks

#### RACI Matrix
- **Responsible** - Who does the work
- **Accountable** - Who signs off
- **Consulted** - Who provides input
- **Informed** - Who needs to know

#### RAPID Framework
- **Recommend** - Proposes decision
- **Agree** - Must agree for decision to proceed
- **Perform** - Implements decision
- **Input** - Provides information
- **Decide** - Makes final decision

## Tools

### Decision Rights Mapping

Visualize who makes what decisions:

1. **List key decision types** in your organization
2. **Identify current decision makers** for each type
3. **Map stakeholders** who should be involved
4. **Define clear boundaries** between decision levels
5. **Document escalation paths** for conflicts

### Governance Canvas

Structure your governance approach:

- **Vision & Strategy**: How are strategic decisions made?
- **Resource Allocation**: Who controls budgets and people?
- **Standards & Policies**: What must be consistent organization-wide?
- **Risk Management**: How are risks identified and managed?
- **Performance**: How is success measured and reviewed?
- **Escalation**: When and how are decisions escalated?

### Decision Velocity Assessment

Measure decision-making speed:

1. **Track decision cycle time** from identification to implementation
2. **Identify bottlenecks** in the decision process
3. **Measure reversibility** - how quickly can decisions be changed?
4. **Assess quality** - what percentage of decisions achieve intended outcomes?

### Decision Architecture Mapping

Map decision flows through your organization:

1. **Identify decision triggers** - what starts the decision process?
2. **Map decision flow** - who is involved at each stage?
3. **Document approval gates** - where decisions get stuck
4. **Identify feedback loops** - how do outcomes inform future decisions?

## Patterns & Anti-patterns

### Patterns (Best Practices)

#### ✅ Clear Decision Rights with Accountability
**Context**: Organizations need fast, quality decisions without conflicts

**Solution**: Establish clear decision rights that:
- Define who makes each type of decision
- Include accountability for outcomes
- Specify required consultation and information sharing
- Enable decision makers with necessary authority and resources

**Benefits**:
- Faster decision-making
- Reduced conflicts and confusion
- Higher quality outcomes
- Clear accountability

#### ✅ Two-Way Door vs One-Way Door Decisions
**Context**: Different decisions require different processes

**Solution**: Categorize decisions as:
- **Two-way doors** (reversible) - Made quickly with minimal process
- **One-way doors** (irreversible) - Require thorough analysis and consultation

**Benefits**:
- Appropriate process for decision importance
- Faster reversible decisions
- Careful consideration of irreversible choices

#### ✅ Escalation by Exception
**Context**: Organizations need to balance autonomy with oversight

**Solution**: Define clear escalation criteria:
- Normal decisions made at appropriate level
- Escalation only when criteria are met (budget, risk, strategic impact)
- Clear escalation paths and timelines

**Benefits**:
- Reduced senior management bottlenecks
- Faster routine decisions
- Appropriate oversight of significant decisions

### Anti-patterns (Pitfalls to Avoid)

#### ❌ Decision by Committee
**Problem**: Every decision requires consensus from large groups

**Why it happens**:
- Desire for buy-in and inclusion
- Fear of making wrong decisions
- Unclear decision rights

**Consequences**:
- Slow decision-making
- Lowest common denominator solutions
- Diffused accountability
- Frustration and disengagement

**Alternative**: Single decision maker with clear consultation requirements

#### ❌ Escalation as Default
**Problem**: Most decisions are escalated to senior levels

**Consequences**:
- Senior management bottlenecks
- Disempowered teams
- Slow response to issues
- Poor development of decision-making skills

**Alternative**: Push decisions to appropriate levels with clear boundaries

#### ❌ HiPPO Decision Making
**Problem**: Highest Paid Person's Opinion wins without proper analysis

**Consequences**:
- Poor decision quality
- Ignored expertise
- Reduced team engagement
- Missed learning opportunities

**Alternative**: Evidence-based decision making with clear criteria

#### ❌ Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Endless analysis without decisions

**Consequences**:
- Missed opportunities
- Competitive disadvantage
- Team frustration
- Resource waste

**Alternative**: Time-boxed analysis with decision deadlines

## Assessment Questions

Use these questions to evaluate your decision-making and governance:

1. Can teams make decisions quickly within their domain of expertise?
2. Are decision rights clearly defined and communicated?
3. Do decisions get stuck waiting for approvals or consensus?
4. Are the right people involved in the right decisions?
5. How quickly can your organization reverse decisions that prove wrong?
6. Do teams have the information they need to make good decisions?
7. Are decisions made at the right level - not too high or too low?
8. How well does your governance balance control with autonomy?

## Next Steps

After analyzing your organization through this lens:

1. **Map current decision rights** using the tools provided
2. **Identify decision bottlenecks** and unnecessary escalations
3. **Design improved governance** balancing speed and quality
4. **Implement changes incrementally** starting with highest impact areas
5. **Monitor decision velocity** and quality metrics
