# Smidigakademiet Organization Design
## Reference System

Welcome to **Laug** - a comprehensive reference system for organizational design and transformation.

## What is Laug?

Laug is a tool designed to help organizations:
- **Understand** their current organizational structure and capabilities
- **Envision** their desired future state
- **Identify** the gaps between where they are and where they want to be
- **Navigate** the transformation journey with proven patterns and practices

## The Lens Approach

Organizations are complex systems that cannot be understood from a single perspective. Laug provides multiple **lenses** through which you can examine your organization, each revealing different aspects and opportunities for improvement.

Each lens offers:
- **Theory** - Foundational concepts and principles
- **Tools** - Practical models and frameworks for analysis
- **Patterns & Anti-patterns** - Best practices to adopt and pitfalls to avoid

## How to Use This Reference System

1. **Start with Understanding** - Begin by exploring the concept of organizational lenses
2. **Select Your Focus** - Choose the lens most relevant to your current challenges
3. **Apply the Framework** - Use the theory, tools, and patterns to analyze your organization
4. **Identify Gaps** - Compare your current state with your vision
5. **Plan Your Journey** - Create actionable steps for transformation
